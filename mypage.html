		<h2> About Me </h2>
		<p> Hello! My name is Zoriyah Carter, and I really love dogs but there is one breed that I extremely feel for. And that is pitbulls. 
			<a href = "https://www.petfinder.com/pet-adoption/dog-adoption/reasons-why-pit-bulls-rule/"> Pitbulls </a> are a misunderstood breed that is considered to be scary and mean. But in reality they are the sweetest and most loyal dogs you'll ever meet. I personally would now because I have a pit bull of my own. She is a 2 year old chocolate Pitbull and she is the funniest and most loving dog you'll meet.</p>

		<h2> Code Experience </h2>
			<p> I learned how to code at my olde school, Abraham Lincoln High school. It was an after school program for senior girl, the course we were in was called code ramp and we have a cool teacher who taught us how to do html, javascript bootstarp, and alittle bit of css.</p>
		<h2> My Goals This Summer...The Future </h2>
		<p> My goals for this summer is to learn a lot about coding. I also want to be more fluent in coding an actually take what I learn to the next level and maybe find another class or internship after the program. I would also look for any college classes that provides computer science. I really want to take this to the next level and actually do the as a career. </p>
